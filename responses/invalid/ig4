The _Intel 4 Series (and older)_ video cards are unable to play *1.7.4* and *future* versions of Minecraft. You will need to buy a _new_ video card or computer to play new versions.
For now, you can still play *1.7.2* or *older* versions of the game. To change your game to a different version, start the launcher. Select *Edit Profile*. In the "Use Version" dropdown menu, select the game version you want. Then click *Save Profile*.
You can try your luck and [update your Graphics Card Drivers|https://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/articles/928493-error-bad-video-card-driver] as some chipsets are still supported. If that doesn't work, then the first part of this message applies.
